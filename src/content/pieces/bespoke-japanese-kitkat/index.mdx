title: "Bespoke Japanese Kitkat"
subtitle: "Limited Edition Collectable Box | 2022"
description: "A limited regional edition collectable box filled with unique flavors found exclusively in japan's various regions. This gift set is designed for a delicious and educational experience on some of japan's most unique kitkat flavors. Inspired by a lack of a japanese logo of the current kitkat design, I wanted to create an unconventional luxury gift set of a brand that isn't normally considered \"luxury\". Kitkat in japan is huge and there are over 400 unique flavors out there, and many that represent specific regions in japan."
