title: "Doterra Package Rebrand"
subtitle: "3-Scent Set | 2020"
description: "A package rebranding of Doterra, is a popular essential oil company. Their initial packaging was primarily lighter text on a darker translucent surface. I wanted to rebrand their aesthetic to a more organic and minimal, yet sophisticated appearance. I primarily stuck with serif fonts because it felt most organic, and I used a sans serif font to give a modern/minimal feel to compliment it. I digitally drew the scent illustrations in a style that felt sketchy, soft, and realistic."
