description: "Dragon Gate is high quality sake originating from Japan's Mt. Fuji. In Chinese mythology, there is a legend of the Dragon Gate located on top of a waterfall cascading from a legendary mountain. It is said that carp who traveled far up enough the waterfall to leap over the gate would transform into a powerful dragon.  The custom bottle includes embossing and texture of the waterfall from the legend, to the carp label in a jumping position, to an actual tera gate inside the bottle, finally ascending to a dragon on the base of the cap. This design to captures the moment just before the final jump towards transformation."
