Emily is a graphic designer and illustrator based in LA county with 
an emphasis in layout design and packaging. To her, graphic design 
is problem solving, and constantly a work in progress. She views her 
work as a constant motivator to strive for improvement and discovering
new ways of approaching design. No work is ever truly complete. When 
sheâ€™s not designing, you might find her at the local bowling alley 
aiming for a new personal best, or at home recharging by napping, 
watching movies or playing videos games.
